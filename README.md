============

This is simply a collection of annotated story lines exported from cableweaver
([site](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaver), [code](https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver)).

This repository only has a `gh-pages` branch for its [public page](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaving).

If you export an interesting story line with cableweaver and want to contribute it,
or if you want to add remarks to an existing story,
feel free to send pull-requests to the `gh-pages` branch.

    Peace,
    The Dod.
