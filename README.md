## CableWeaving


This repository only has a `gh-pages` branch, which is what you see at the [**CableWeaving site**](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaving).

CableWeaving is not code, but rather journalistic stories -
based on [CableGate](ihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) information
that was analyzed with a tool called [CableWeaver](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaver).

### How to contribute

If you find an interesting story line with cableweaver and want to contribute it,
or if you want to add remarks to an existing story,
feel free to send pull-requests to the `gh-pages` branch.

If you don't know how to do that, would rather stay anonymous, etc.
you can [contact me securely](https://dubiousdod.org/ask4secret) instead.


Peace, The Dod.
