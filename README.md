## CableWeaving


This repository only has a `gh-pages` branch, which is what you see at the [**CableWeaving site**](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaving).

CableWeaving is not code, but rather journalistic stories -
based on [CableGate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) information
that was analyzed with a tool called [CableWeaver](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaver).

### How to contribute

CableWeaving story-lines are stored at [codepen.io](http://codepen.io).

* If you want to add remarks to an existing story, just fork it at codepen.
* If you find a new story-line with cableWeaver, export it as a codepen "pen".

In both cases you can either [contact me securely](https://dubiousdod.org/ask4secret)
or tweet to [@TheRealDod](https://twiter.com/TheRealDod) with a link to your pen.

Peace, The Dod.
