          <p><a href="http://is.gd/CableWeaver">CableWeaver</a> lets you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak">CableGate</a> references between cables in context, and select cables that relate to the same story - thus creating <em>story lines</em>. It's pretty easy to work with (once you read the <a href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki">instructions</a>) and you can easily <a href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki/Installing-on-your-own-server-or-home-computer">install</a> it on your own server (or home computer), but in order to demonstrate what it's good <em>for</em>, here are a few story lines with summaries and cable excerpts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="fil-mish-mish.html">Fil mish-mish</a> - the story of Palestine's cellular spectrum</li>
<li><a href="cashless-in-gaza.html">Cashless in Gaza</a> - <em>work in progress...</em></li>
<li><a href="galileo-takeover.html">Galileo takeover</a> - <em>work in progress...</em></li>
</ul>

Credit (to me and/or CableWeaver) could be nice, I'd also love to get a link to whatever you do with this material, but don't feel obliged. Many people have already paid dearly (and are still paying) for releasing these cables. It would be a shame not to extract any insights we can out of them in order to inform the people.</p>

<p>You might also decide to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki">use CableWeaver</a> yourself.
You can can then click the <code>export</code> button and generate a story-line pages similar to the ones you see here.<br>
If you create something interesting (or if you have information to add to an existing story), there are 2 ways to contribute it here:
<ul>
<li>You can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaving">fork this site</a> and send a pull-request to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
<li>If you don't understand the previous sentence (it's OK), simply <a target="_blank" href="https://dubiousdod.org/contact">contact me</a>
and we'll work something out :)</li>
</ul>
