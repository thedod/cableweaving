          <p><a href="http://is.gd/CableWeaver">CableWeaver</a> lets you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak">CableGate</a> references between cables in context, and select cables that relate to the same story - thus creating <em>story lines</em>. It's pretty easy to work with (once you read the <a href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki">instructions</a>) and you can easily <a href="https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki/Installing-on-your-own-server-or-home-computer">install</a> it on your own server (or home computer), but in order to demonstrate what it's good <em>for</em>, here are a few story lines with summaries and cable excerpts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="fil-mish-mish.html">Fil mish-mish</a> - the story of Palestine's cellular spectrum</li>
<li><a href="cashless-in-gaza.html">Cashless in Gaza</a> - <em>a work in progress...</em></li>
<li><em>To be continued...</em></li>
</ul><p>This is what I've managed to achieve so far <em>without</em> being an investigative journalist/blogger. If you <em>are</em> one, I'm sure you can do a lot more with CableWeaver.</p>

<p>Also note that the content here is in the public domain (see legaleze below). Feel free to publish any page (or part of it) you see on this site. Credit (to me and/or CableWeaver) could be nice, I'd also love to get a link to whatever you do with this material, but don't feel obliged. Many people have already paid dearly (and are still paying) for releasing these cables. It would be a shame not to extract any insights we can out of them in order to inform the people.</p>

<p>Peace,
